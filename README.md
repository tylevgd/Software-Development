### Personal Bio ("who are you?")
*(WIP)* I am a Junior/Senior in LHS, CVHS, and STC. I am an aspiring computer scientist with committed hobbies in animation, drawing/design, music composition, sound design, video editing, filmmaking, and playing violin. With some personal projects utilizing most of these; such as launching a weather balloon into space and making a professional video out of it (https://youtu.be/WrgiJLvqXPE?si=9NogeWwhYnsLocU-); and animating a horror series in a video game's (Geometry Dash) level editor over the span of 1.5 years and over 700 hours put into the episodes so far (https://youtu.be/YoaOadtepHQ?si=1JOk-8OamkKY4N3o). Undeniably niche but a project I'm proud of nonetheless.
