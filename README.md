# Software Development

### Titles:
**Name:** Tylev *(username)*  
**Education:** Launch High School, Canyon View High School, Southest Technical College  
**Course Name:** Software Development I (TESD 1400)  

### Description ("why does this repo exist?")  
This repository is for my Software Development class. I will be using this repo to save any of my future assignments. I am also going to treat this account as a potential portfolio for any future jobs.
   
### Personal Bio ("who are you?")  
As of August 2025, I am a Senior in Launch High School, Canyon View High School, and Southwest Technical College. I am an aspiring computer scientist with an assortment of hobbies in animation, drawing/design, writing, music composition, sound design, video editing, filmmaking, and playing violin--with some extensive school/personal projects utilizing most of these skills; such as releasing a weather balloon attached to a camera and parachute into space, and editing a professional video presentation out of it ([HOW TO RECORD SPACE (a short film)](https://youtu.be/WrgiJLvqXPE?si=9NogeWwhYnsLocU-)); and animating a horror series in a video game's level editor (Geometry Dash) over the span of 1.5 years with over 700 hours of work so far ([NOX ep1 PILOT](https://youtu.be/YoaOadtepHQ?si=1JOk-8OamkKY4N3o)). *(A niche project but one I'm proud of nonetheless.)*

### End Goals ("why are you taking this class?")  
I am taking Software Development to gain some knowledge on Computer Science; I will utilize this class as a form of scaffolding for the more extensive classes. My hope is that this class will not only indroduce me to the world of developing software, but give me experience and a map to hold onto as I dive into the strenuous world of Computer Science.
